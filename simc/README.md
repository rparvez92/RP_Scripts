This repository holds the codes for comparing the Data Vs Simulation.
Data is Dummy Subtracted.
Simulation is simc simulation.
...
DataVsSimPlot_MultiDataMultiDummy.C is the final developped code.
This naming is due to the fact that this code is capable to take multiple data run and 
dummy run to incorporate in the comparison.
...
You must have PDFs directory created prior to run the code. This directory holds the 
created plots. To run the code, run:
root -l DataVsSimPlot_MultiDataMultiDummy.C
